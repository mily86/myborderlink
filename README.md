üìÑ Code Explanations for MyBorderLink
Below explanation of the key Flutter, PHP, and MySQL components used in the MyBorderLink officer registration and login.
________________________________________
üì± Flutter App Code Explanation
1. Splash Screen (splashscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Shows branding and slogan.
‚Ä¢	Uses a 4-second Timer to auto-navigate to the login screen.
Timer(const Duration(seconds: 4), () {
  Navigator.pushReplacement(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const LoginScreen()),
  );
});
________________________________________
2. Login Screen (loginscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Inputs: Officer ID (numeric), Password
‚Ä¢	Validates input and shows errors.
‚Ä¢	Sends POST request to login_user.php
‚Ä¢	Uses SharedPreferences for ‚ÄúRemember Me‚Äù
final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('${MyConfig.apiUrl}login_user.php'),
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  body: jsonEncode({'officer_id': officerId, 'password': password}),
);
‚Ä¢	On success, it redirects to MainScreen() with user info.
________________________________________
3. Register Screen (registerscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Inputs: Officer ID, Full Name, Email, Password, Checkpoint
‚Ä¢	Validates all fields, sends POST to register_user.php
‚Ä¢	Displays success/failure messages
final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('${MyConfig.apiUrl}register_user.php'),
  body: jsonEncode({
    'officer_id': officerId,
    'full_name': fullName,
    'email': email,
    'password': password,
    'checkpoint_location': checkpoint,
  }),
);
________________________________________
4. Main Screen (mainscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Displays officer‚Äôs name, ID, and checkpoint.
‚Ä¢	Contains logout button at the bottom.
‚Ä¢	Prevents back navigation with WillPopScope
________________________________________
5. Log Model (log_model.dart)

‚Ä¢	Model Definition:

o	This file defines a LogEntry model, which represents the structure of a log entry in the app. It holds properties like:

ÔÇß	date: the date of the log
ÔÇß	vehiclePlate: the plate number of the vehicle
ÔÇß	inspectionType: type of the inspection conducted
ÔÇß	findings: details of the inspection findings
ÔÇß	location: where the inspection took place
ÔÇß	officerId: the ID of the officer who performed the inspection

‚Ä¢	Methods:
o	toJson(): Converts the LogEntry object into a JSON format to be sent in an API request.

Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
  'date': date,
  'vehicle_plate': vehiclePlate,
  'inspection_type': inspectionType,
  'findings': findings,
  'location': location,
  'officer_id': officerId,
};

o	fromJson(): Converts JSON data (usually from a server response) back into a LogEntry object.

factory LogEntry.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
  return LogEntry(
    date: json['date'] ?? '',
    vehiclePlate: json['vehicle_plate'] ?? '',
    inspectionType: json['inspection_type'] ?? '',
    findings: json['findings'] ?? '',
    location: json['location'] ?? '',
    officerId: json['officer_id'],
  );
}

‚Ä¢	Purpose:

o	This model ensures that data related to logs can be easily serialized and deserialized, which is critical for network communication (API calls) and data management.

_______________________________________
6. Log Insertion Screen (loginsertionscreen.dart)

Features and Functionality:

‚Ä¢	Inputs:

o	Date (uses a date picker for easy selection)
o	Vehicle Plate (text field)
o	Inspection Type (dropdown selection)
o	Findings (text field for details)
o	Location (text field)

‚Ä¢	Input Validation:

o	Validates fields before submission to ensure data integrity. Use Form and TextFormField with validation rules (e.g., checking if fields are empty or formatted correctly).

‚Ä¢	Sending POST Request:
o	Sends the log data (date, vehicle plate, inspection type, findings, and location) to the server for insertion into the database.
o	The request is structured as:
	final response = await http.post(
  	Uri.parse('${MyConfig.apiUrl}insert_log.php'),
  	headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  	body: jsonEncode({
    	'date': date,
    	'vehicle_plate': vehiclePlate,
    	'inspection_type': inspectionType,
    	'findings': findings,
    	'location': location,
  	}),
	);

‚Ä¢	Success/Error Handling:

o	Displays success or error messages based on the response from the server using SnackBar.
o	If the insertion is successful, the screen may clear the input fields or show a confirmation message.

‚Ä¢	Navigation:
o	After successful log insertion, it navigate to another screen (e.g., a confirmation or the main screen) based on the requirements.
________________________________________
7. Log Display (logdisplay.dart)

‚Ä¢	Fetching Data:
o	Uses a FutureBuilder to fetch log data from the server. It asynchronously loads the data from the API endpoint and updates the UI accordingly.

‚Ä¢	Inputs:
o	Search Filter: Provides a TextField for users to filter logs by date or other relevant information.

‚Ä¢	Displaying Logs:
o	Displays logs in a ListView, where each entry shows:
ÔÇß	Inspection Type
ÔÇß	Vehicle Plate
ÔÇß	Date
ÔÇß	Findings
ÔÇß	Location

‚Ä¢	Request to Server:
o	The fetchLogs() function sends a GET request to the server to retrieve logs. The API request might look like:

		final response = await http.get(
  		Uri.parse('${MyConfig.apiUrl}fetch_logs.php'),
  		headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
		);
‚Ä¢	Error and Loading States:

o	The app manages different states like loading, error, and empty states using FutureBuilder:

ÔÇß	Loading: Shows a loading indicator while fetching data.
ÔÇß	Error: Displays an error message if the API request fails.
ÔÇß	Empty: If no logs are found, a message can be shown.

‚Ä¢	Navigation:

o	This screen is more about viewing data, so navigation might not be as critical unless need to redirect to another screen for adding new logs or viewing detailed log information.
________________________________________
üîô MyConfig (myconfig.dart)
‚Ä¢	Stores base API URL:
class MyConfig {
  static const String apiUrl = " http://192.168.100.15/myborderlink/php/";

}
________________________________________
üêò PHP Backend Code Explanation
1. Database Connection (dbconnect.php)
‚Ä¢	Connects to MySQL database using MySQLi.
‚Ä¢	Used in all backend scripts.
________________________________________
2. Register User (register_user.php)
‚Ä¢	Receives POST data from Flutter.
‚Ä¢	Validates required fields.
‚Ä¢	Checks if officer_id or email already exists.
‚Ä¢	Hashes password before inserting.
$password_hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
‚Ä¢	On success, returns JSON with status: success
________________________________________
3. Login User (login_user.php)
‚Ä¢	Receives officer ID and password.
‚Ä¢	Queries database for matching officer_id
‚Ä¢	Verifies hashed password using password_verify()
if (password_verify($password, $row['officer_password'])) {
    unset($row['officer_password']);
    sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'success', 'data' => $row]);
}
‚Ä¢	Returns officer info if login is successful.
________________________________________
4. Insert Log (insert_log.php)

<?php

header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS');
header('Content-Type: application/json');

include_once('dbconnect.php');

$data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);

if (
    !isset($data['officer_id']) ||
    !isset($data['date']) ||
    !isset($data['vehicle_plate']) ||
    !isset($data['inspection_type']) ||
    !isset($data['findings']) ||
    !isset($data['location'])
) {
    sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'failed', 'message' => 'Missing required fields']);
    exit;
}

$officer_id = $data['officer_id'];
$date = $data['date'];
$vehicle_plate = $data['vehicle_plate'];
$inspection_type = $data['inspection_type'];
$findings = $data['findings'];
$location = $data['location'];

$stmt = $conn->prepare("INSERT INTO tbl_logs (officer_id, date, vehicle_plate, inspection_type, findings, location) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)");
$stmt->bind_param("isssss", $officer_id, $date, $vehicle_plate, $inspection_type, $findings, $location);

if ($stmt->execute()) {
    sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Log inserted successfully.']);
} else {
    sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'failed', 'message' => 'Insert failed: ' . $stmt->error]);
}
$stmt->close();
$conn->close();

function sendJsonResponse($response) {
    echo json_encode($response);
}
?>

Purpose: This script inserts a new log into the database with details such as officer_id, date, vehicle_plate, inspection_type, findings, and location.

How it works:

CORS Setup: Similar to the first script, it allows cross-origin requests and sets headers for methods and content type.

Database Connection: It includes the database connection.

Input Validation: It checks if all required fields are provided in the request. If any are missing, it returns an error message.

Insert Query: An INSERT query adds the log data into the tbl_logs table.

Response: After insertion, it returns a success or failure message based on whether the query executed successfully.
________________________________________
5. Log Display(get_logs.php)

<?php

header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS');
header('Content-Type: application/json');

include_once('dbconnect.php');

$data = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);

if (!isset($data['officer_id'])) {
    sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'failed', 'message' => 'Officer ID required.']);
    exit;
}

$officer_id = $data['officer_id'];

$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT id, date, vehicle_plate, inspection_type, findings, location FROM tbl_logs WHERE officer_id = ? ORDER BY date DESC");
$stmt->bind_param("i", $officer_id);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();

$logs = [];
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    $logs[] = $row;
}

sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'success', 'logs' => $logs]);

$stmt->close();
$conn->close();

function sendJsonResponse($response) {
    echo json_encode($response);
}
?>

Purpose: This script retrieves logs from the database based on the officer_id passed in the request.

How it works:

CORS Setup: It includes headers to allow cross-origin requests and specify accepted methods.

Database Connection: The script includes a database connection file (dbconnect.php).

Input Validation: It checks if officer_id is provided in the request. If not, it returns a failure message.

Database Query: A SELECT query fetches logs from tbl_logs where the officer_id matches, ordered by date in descending order.

Sending Response: The results are returned as a JSON response containing the logs.

Closing Connections: It closes the database connection and the prepared statement.

## üöÄ How to Run the App

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myborderlink.git
   cd myborderlink



This assignment helped me to understand several Flutter concepts:

‚Ä¢  Connecting Flutter with PHP backend via HTTP POST
‚Ä¢  Form validation and user feedback using TextEditingController and SnackBar
‚Ä¢  State management with setState and UI updates
‚Ä¢  Secure password hashing and verification in PHP using password_hash() and password_verify()
‚Ä¢  Session-like persistence with SharedPreferences
‚Ä¢  Ensures that data related to logs can be easily serialized and deserialized, which is critical for network communication (API calls) and data management.



This assignment gave me practical experience with building a functional Flutter application. I learned how to manage app state and lifecycle with StatefulWidget and initState(). Besides, I‚Äôm also learned how to connect the Flutter frontend with a PHP/MySQL backend using HTTP requests. It also helped me to understand how to apply password hashing and backend integration using PHP and MySQL. Furthermore, I‚Äôm also learned about secure user registration and login functionality using hashed passwords.
In Addidtion, I'm also learned how to ensures that data related to logs can be easily serialized and deserialized, which is critical for network communication (API calls) and data management.
Overall, this assignment strengthened my understanding of Flutter's widget tree, communicating with external APIs and handling JSON responses, UI design principles, and error handling and feedback via SnackBars and conditional loading indicators.
