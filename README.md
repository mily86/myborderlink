üìÑ Code Explanations for MyBorderLink
Below explanation of the key Flutter, PHP, and MySQL components used in the MyBorderLink officer registration and login.
________________________________________
üì± Flutter App Code Explanation
1. Splash Screen (splashscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Shows branding and slogan.
‚Ä¢	Uses a 4-second Timer to auto-navigate to the login screen.
Timer(const Duration(seconds: 4), () {
  Navigator.pushReplacement(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const LoginScreen()),
  );
});
________________________________________
2. Login Screen (loginscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Inputs: Officer ID (numeric), Password
‚Ä¢	Validates input and shows errors.
‚Ä¢	Sends POST request to login_user.php
‚Ä¢	Uses SharedPreferences for ‚ÄúRemember Me‚Äù
final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('${MyConfig.apiUrl}login_user.php'),
  headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
  body: jsonEncode({'officer_id': officerId, 'password': password}),
);
‚Ä¢	On success, it redirects to MainScreen() with user info.
________________________________________
3. Register Screen (registerscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Inputs: Officer ID, Full Name, Email, Password, Checkpoint
‚Ä¢	Validates all fields, sends POST to register_user.php
‚Ä¢	Displays success/failure messages
final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('${MyConfig.apiUrl}register_user.php'),
  body: jsonEncode({
    'officer_id': officerId,
    'full_name': fullName,
    'email': email,
    'password': password,
    'checkpoint_location': checkpoint,
  }),
);
________________________________________
4. Main Screen (mainscreen.dart)
‚Ä¢	Displays officer‚Äôs name, ID, and checkpoint.
‚Ä¢	Contains logout button at the bottom.
‚Ä¢	Prevents back navigation with WillPopScope
________________________________________
üîô MyConfig (myconfig.dart)
‚Ä¢	Stores base API URL:
class MyConfig {
  static const String apiUrl = " http://192.168.100.15/myborderlink/php/";
}
________________________________________
üêò PHP Backend Code Explanation
1. Database Connection (dbconnect.php)
‚Ä¢	Connects to MySQL database using MySQLi.
‚Ä¢	Used in all backend scripts.
________________________________________
2. Register User (register_user.php)
‚Ä¢	Receives POST data from Flutter.
‚Ä¢	Validates required fields.
‚Ä¢	Checks if officer_id or email already exists.
‚Ä¢	Hashes password before inserting.
$password_hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT);
‚Ä¢	On success, returns JSON with status: success
________________________________________
3. Login User (login_user.php)
‚Ä¢	Receives officer ID and password.
‚Ä¢	Queries database for matching officer_id
‚Ä¢	Verifies hashed password using password_verify()
if (password_verify($password, $row['officer_password'])) {
    unset($row['officer_password']);
    sendJsonResponse(['status' => 'success', 'data' => $row]);
}
‚Ä¢	Returns officer info if login is successful.
________________________________________
üóÉÔ∏è MySQL Table: tbl_officers
CREATE TABLE tbl_officers (
  officer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  officer_fullname VARCHAR(100),
  officer_email VARCHAR(100),
  officer_password VARCHAR(255),
  officer_checkpoint VARCHAR(50),
  officer_datereg DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
‚Ä¢	officer_password is stored in hashed format.
‚Ä¢	officer_id must be unique and integer.

üîå PHP Backend API

register_user.php
Handles officer registration. Validates unique email and officer ID, hashes the password, and inserts into the database.

login_user.php
Handles officer login. Accepts Officer ID and password, verifies the hashed password, and returns user details if successful.


## üöÄ How to Run the App

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myborderlink.git
   cd myborderlink



This assignment helped me to understand several Flutter concepts:

‚Ä¢  Connecting Flutter with PHP backend via HTTP POST
‚Ä¢  Form validation and user feedback using TextEditingController and SnackBar
‚Ä¢  State management with setState and UI updates
‚Ä¢  Secure password hashing and verification in PHP using password_hash() and password_verify()
‚Ä¢  Session-like persistence with SharedPreferences



This assignment gave me practical experience with building a functional Flutter application. I learned how to manage app state and lifecycle with StatefulWidget and initState(). Besides, I‚Äôm also learned how to connect the Flutter frontend with a PHP/MySQL backend using HTTP requests. It also helped me to understand how to apply password hashing and backend integration using PHP and MySQL. Furthermore, I‚Äôm also learned about secure user registration and login functionality using hashed passwords. Overall, this assignment strengthened my understanding of Flutter's widget tree, communicating with external APIs and handling JSON responses, UI design principles, and error handling and feedback via SnackBars and conditional loading indicators.
